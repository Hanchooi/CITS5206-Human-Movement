# Human Movement Tracking and Analysis

Our client (researchers) want to find out the effect of human travelling habit on their fitness.

This project is to help our client to collect Human Movement Data for their research.

This project consist of two parts:

1) An app for survey participants to provide their location data and related habits. 
2) A PC software to preproccess and integrate the data from mobile app and smartwatch for easier use.

In the time being, Part 1's app only run on Android phone and Part 2's PC software only runs on Mac.

Due to time constraint, we only choose one platform that is more suitable. 
However, this project can be extended into cross-platforms in the future.

For Part 2's PC software, we prioritize Mac because our client uses Mac.
